## General Mod Structure
* How do we get to the dimension?
    * Portals (multiblock or single block)
        * A portal that's underwater
        * Prismarine (or something related to the guardian temple)
        * Other ocean stuff like conduits or heart of the sea
    * Have it related to the underwater temple's gold blocks

        * You would have to go to this structure and either click on it or touch it
        * It should do something to indicate that it's an active portal, maybe give off particles

## The two layers of the dimension
![](img/layers.png)

    * It has sea lanterns
    * The player either has permanent night vision here, or maybe the water emits light

    * The water may be a different block that mimics water, but is darker in color

    * Something with conduits?
    * Scuba tanks

* Trenches aka fat ravines?
* Underwater cities on ocean floor, should have really tall building that stick up so they are easy to find

### Effects
* A sickness from moving between ocean layers

    * Once you get an item/armor set, you can move between the layers

### Sounds
