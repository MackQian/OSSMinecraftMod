# The Deep Blue Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members and developers pledge to make participation in our
community and the larger Minecraft Modding community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Minecraft modding is about having fun
and working together to create great things in this sandbox game.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Our team is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Our team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces of our mod. This includes our project's
code, our issue tracker, as well as any future forum posts and public Discord servers that may be
created for our mod.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to our team at thedeepbluemod@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All of our team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
