# The Deep Blue

The Deep Blue is a new dimension that is fully underwater. You spawn near the top in small caves. This is where you'll find the only air in the dimension, so we recomend coming to this biome geared with a resperation helmet and water breathing potions. Don't worry though, you'll be able to craft a scuba tank eventually.<br /><br />
Once you decide to leave the saftey of these caves you'll find yourself in a vast open ocean. Out here, there is no where to hide. Be carfeul because these open waters are home to many large predators. The waters get dark as you keep smimming deeper and deeper. If you manage to make it to the bottom you'll be welcomed by a faint glow coming from some caves. Certainly it must be safer in there than it is exposed out here?
